## Project Design

Manasana was a 9 day project during January of 2017. You can view the original design timeline and proposal [here](./docs/README.md)

[Wireframes](./wireframes/) were designed to show basic user interaction and the structure of the site.

From there, a rough [Component Hierarchy](./component-hierarchy.md), [Databse Schema](./schema.md) and [Sample State](./sample-state.md) were planned out.
